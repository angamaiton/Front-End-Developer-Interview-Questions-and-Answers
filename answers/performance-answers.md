#### What tools would you use to find a performance bug in your code?

The set of tools depends upon the language used ­ here are some specific tools I
use for different languages, though:

**General-purpose**:
  - Chrome Dev Tools (Console): The console is my bread and butter when it comes
    to debugging things ­ I monitor performance, output, etc. from here.

#### What are some ways you can improve your website's scrolling performance?

* On-demand (dynamic) loading
* Refactoring/removing styles like gradients or box-shadows
* Minimize the amount of painting/repainting necessary for a browser
