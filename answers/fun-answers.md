#### What's a cool project that you've recently worked on?

I recently built a cross-platform language-learning application I use for my
studies.

#### What are some things you like about the developer tools you use?

I recently picked up Vim and tmux, with all of the fun proselytizing that
accompanies them. I love how they help with my productivity, I love that I'm
still discovering new things to do with them, and I love all of the geekery out
there on the internet about them.

I have a huge list of dotfiles and things that I'm continually working on to
improve my productivity Â­ feel free to check it out at
